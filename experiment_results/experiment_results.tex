\section{Experiment Results}

The experiment consisted in evolving in a three dimensional universe, with cubes
as units and an adaptation of the diffusion rule, each Conway pentomino and
observing it's behaviour while watching out for configurations such as still
lifes, oscillators gliders and specially, glider guns.

\subsection{The Settings}
The simulations were done in Ready, a cross-platform implementation of various
reaction-difussion systems designed to explore both, continuous and discrete
cellular automata on grids and arbitrary meshes \cite{ready-golly-gang}.
Alas, precisely because it can be used with continuous and discrete universes,
Ready is not optimized for experiments of this kind, provoquing quite slow
evolutions.

Each experiment started with a pentomino in the center of a $256\times256$ empty
cube; the simulation ended when there were no more alive cells or when the cells
filled the space and started to interfere one another. Since Ready does not
permit to move the view when the simulation is running, each pentomino scenario
was run, at least, three times in order to obtain a front, lateral and in angle
view of the evolution. The complete evolutions can be observed
in~\ref{appendix:main-app}.
