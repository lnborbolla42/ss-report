\section{Conclusion}
Even though the main objective was not achieved (a glider gun was
not found), these experiments led to some interesting results
(see section~\ref{sec:configurations-found}): five gliders were found, one
oscillator, one replicator, and three puffer trains.

It was also found that whenever two puffer-2 (see figure~\ref{fig:iso-puffer-1v})
frontally collided, a glider-4 (see figure \ref{fig:iso-glider-4}) emerges.

Although some structures are similar to each other (like glider-1 and glider-3),
other structures are particularly interesting, for example, the
replicator structure (see figure~\ref{fig:iso-puffer-1}):  the replicator-1,
although could not be probed in this set of experiments, seems to be somehow
important in the process of generating gliders; this supposition is made by the
observation of the evolution of the s-pentomino population: at least four
gliders were created and the pattern that appeared to create them kept
replicating in the population; but the more the population grew, the more the
population got in its way.

It is important to notice that two important limitations in these experiments were
the simulator and the computing power; Ready, apart from being quite slow in the
iterations, does not offer friendly ways to explore the space and can only rotate
and be zoomed towards the center. Also, due to the slow down in the evolutions,
the space defined (a $256\times256\times256$ cube) was limited; in several
pentominoes, the evolutions had to be stopped because it was too crowded; maybe
in bigger spaces it would be easier to identify configurations.
