\section{Conclusion}
Talk about how long it took to view the simulations, even when the processor was HQ
Talk about the configurations found (yayy), why it is important to find a
glider gun (then, they would have "c√≥mputo universal").

Even though the main objective was not achieved (a glider gun was
not found), these experiments leaded to some interesting results
(see section~\ref{sec:configurations-found}); for example, a
replicator structure (see figure~\ref{fig:iso-puffer-1});  the
replicator-1, although could not be probed in this set of
experiments, this configuration appears to be somehow important
in the process of generating gliders; this supposition is made by
the observation of the evolution of the s-pentomino population;
at least four gliders were created and the pattern that appeared
to create them kept replicating in the population; but the more
the population grew, the more the population got in its way.
