\section{Conclusion}
Talk about how long it took to view the simulations, even when the processor was HQ
Talk about the configurations found (yayy), why it is important to find a
glider gun (then, they would have "c√≥mputo universal").

Even though the main objective was not achieved: a glider gun was not found,
these experiments leaded to some interesting results (see
section~\ref{sec:configurations-found}); for example, a replicator structure
(see figure~\ref{fig:iso-puffer-1}); the replicator-1, althougth could not be
probboed in this set of experiments, appears to be the key to generate gliders;
this supposition is made by the observation of the evolution of the s-pentomino population.
